          </h2>
          <p>Project manager for the <a href="https://elisecare.org/en/" target="_blank">Elise Care</a> association in 2017-2018, I had the opportunity to follow up on donor contracts and to write several grant reports, in particular for the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. In addition, I participated in improving the data collection and reporting of data phase during several field missions to IDP camps in Iraqi Kurdistan. This experience allowed me to strengthen my skills in defining and monitoring reliable indicators for humanitarian projects.</p>
          <p>In addition, my study project at <a href="https://www.iris-sup.org" target="_blank">IRIS Sup'</a> school was carried out in group under the supervision of an English-speaking person based in London. The aim was to strengthen the creation of multi-stakeholder partnerships in an emerging country where civil society is highly active. This project for the benefit of the <a href="https://www.iaran.org">IARAN</a> consortium was coordinated through the organization of multiple meetings and the drafting of project documents all in English.</p>
          <p>I also have a rich operational experience in the emergency field as a firefighter in Paris. From 2013 to 2015, I was in direct command of a fire and rescue company for the benefit of populations located to the north of Paris and in Seine-Saint-Denis. In addition, in 2015-2016, my duties led me to coordinate several projects in the areas of human support and information technology at the level of the general Staff. Highly organized and autonomous, my various experiences have enabled me to develop a capacity of analysis and synthesis useful in the management of complex projects.</p>
          <p>Now, my new dream is to become a fullstack JavaScript developper in 2021.</p>
